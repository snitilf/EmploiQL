The anticipated compensation listed above and the value of core and optional employee benefits offered by Boston Scientific (BSC) – see www.bscbenefitsconnect.com--will vary based on actual location of the position and other pertinent factors considered in determining actual compensation for the role. Compensation will be commensurate with demonstrable level of experience and training, pertinent education including licensure and certifications, among other relevant business or organizational needs. At BSC, it is not typical for an individual to be hired near the bottom or top of the anticipated salary range listed above.

Compensation for hourly, non-sales roles may also include variable compensation from time to time (e.g., any overtime and shift differential) and annual bonus target (subject to plan eligibility and other requirements).

Compensation for salaried, non-sales roles may also include variable compensation, i.e., annual bonus target and long-term incentives (subject to plan eligibility and other requirements).

Compensation for sales roles is governed by Sales Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes certain annual non-discretionary incentives based on predetermined objectives).

Our organization is across Canada and has commercial representation in 140 countries.

This job involves regular collaboration with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders across Canada, the U.S., and/or internationally, making proficiency in English essential for effective communication and alignment. English is necessary for engaging with a range of documentation and maintaining effective communication if interacting with external clients or vendors.

As detailed in the job description, this job involves communicating, both verbally and in writing, with other Boston Scientific teams located across Canada, the United States and/or with our international clients and partners. International customers and partners represent an important part of our activities. Based on an evaluation, we have determined that the duties of Software Development Intern / Stagiaire en développement de logicielsposition require knowledge of English in addition to French (oral and written). We also determined that the English language skills already required of other employees do not permit the performance of English language skills tasks related to Software Development Intern / Stagiaire en développement de logiciels position.

However, in Québec, Boston Scientific limits as much as possible the number of positions for which it requires the knowledge of another language than French. Boston Scientific solely requires proficiency in English where it is necessary for the performance of an employee’s duties.

Company: CSC Generation
Location: Montreal, Quebec CA
Employment Type: Internship
Posted: 2026-01-09T00:00:00.000Z

Salary: Not specified

Description:
CSC Generation is a technology driven holding company that acquires and operates established consumer brands, including One Kings Lane, Backcountry, and Sur La Table. Across 13 brands generating over $1B in annual revenue, we improve how these businesses run by building shared platforms, automation, and data tooling that scale across the portfolio.

This role is platform work at the intersection of e-commerce, operations, and data. You will ship production changes used daily, and you will learn reliable delivery through small pull requests, code review, and disciplined debugging.

This Junior Software Engineer role is for early career full-stack engineers who want to grow quickly. You will work primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript, with React on the front end and Node on the back end, and over time you will own small features end to end.

What you get to do:
• Build and refine user facing features using React, TypeScript, and modernfront endtooling.
• Implement and integrate simple backend services using Node and TypeScript or JavaScript, including REST style APIs and basic data models.
• Work with senior engineers to break down requirements into small, shippable pieces and implement them end to end.
• Write clear, maintainable code and basic tests for both front end andback endfunctionality.
• Collaborate with product and design to polish UX details, handle edge cases, and improve performance and reliability.
• Use AIassistedtools, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, in a disciplined way to speed up development while keeping code quality high.
• Participatein code reviews, ask questions, and steadily grow toward owning small features and services independently.
• Practice good engineering hygiene: version control, small pull requests, clear commit messages, and lightweight documentation.
• Invest in your own growth: read documentation, keep notes, and reflect on feedback you receive.

What you bring:
• You do not need to check every box. We are open to candidates who are early in their careers but show strong fundamentals and learning habits.
• Experience with JavaScript or TypeScript through coursework, internships, personal projects, bootcamps, or 0 to 3 years of professional work.
• Somehands-onexperience with React andcomponent basedUI development, including state management and basic forms.
• Some exposure to backend development in Node, for example simple APIs, scripts, orserver sidelogic.
• Comfort with HTML and CSS, responsive layouts, and common web patterns.
• Basic understanding of HTTP, JSON, and howfront endcode communicates with backend services.
• Some exposure to testing tools on either front end or back end, or a clear willingness to learn them.
• Strong debugging mindset: you read error messages, check logs, and try small experiments before asking for help.
• Evidence of being studious andself directed. For example:
• Youmaintainpersonal notes or a knowledge base.
• You can describe something difficult you taught yourself recently and how you went about it.
• Clear communication, willingness to receive feedback, and a growth mindset.

Nice to have
• Experience with a web framework such as Express, Next.js, or similar.
• Exposure to databases or data storage, even if only in simple projects.
• Awareness of accessibility, performance, and basic security considerations.
• Prior use of AI coding assistants or strong interest in using them responsibly in your workflow.
• Experience with ecommerce, design systems, orcomponentlibraries.

How we hire for this role:
• We use two small, focused exercises as part of the process:
• A front end React and TypeScript exercise that looks like a real feature you might ship.
• A simple backend Node exercise that tests API and data modeling fundamentals.

We look for:
• Clear, readable code and correct behavior for the core requirements.
• A methodical approach to state and data, not clever tricks.
• Evidence that you read the specification carefully and handle edge cases thoughtfully.
• Perfect completion is notrequired. We care a lot about:
• Howyouapproach problems when you areuncertain.
• Whether you leave comments ornoteswhen you run out of time.
• How you explain your decisions and describe what you would improve with more time.
• Later stages focus on how you debug in real time, how you respond to feedback, and how you work with frustration and ambiguity without shutting down.

What''s in it for you:
• This role is designed to turn early career engineers into reliable full stack contributors through real production work and tight feedback loops. You will ship user-facing features, contribute to backend services, and learn the day to day engineering habits that matter most: scoping work into small increments, writing readable code, reviewing code thoughtfully, and debugging issues end to end.
• Within your first 6 months, you will ship production changes and take ownership of clearly scoped features with light guidance through code review. Diligent engineers in this role often move faster, owning larger features earlier than is typical for junior roles, because we favor small teams, fast iteration, and real responsibility. The pace is real, and support is there when you need it, but you are expected to drive.

In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:
• Executive Access: Direct access to decision makers so good ideas do not get stuck in long approval chains, and so your work can ship faster.
• AI-First Skill Building: Hands on experience using AI-assisted development tools with the same expectations we have for any code: reviewable, testable, and maintainable.
• Career Growth: Increasing scope and ownership based on demonstrated readiness, including opportunities to expand across frontend and backend work as you develop.
• Competitive benefits: Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical, dental, vision, supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies.

English is necessary for engaging with a range of documentation and maintaining effective communication if interacting with external clients or vendors.

As detailed in the job description, this job involves communicating, both verbally and in writing, with other Boston Scientific teams located across Canada, the United States and/or with our international clients and partners.

SEED
is a pioneering group within Electronic Arts that combines creativity with applied research. We explore, build, and help define the future of interactive entertainment.

We exist at EA to deliver and foster inspiring innovation for our games and our players. We do this through exploration, research, prototypes, and never-ending curiosity. We collaborate with game teams and industry partners and also publish our research within our industry and to the public. We pursue long-term applied research while staying relevant to the present by delivering artifacts along the way to game teams and technology groups inside EA. Some of our research includes bringing digital characters to life, using machine learning for game AI and content creation, and developing novel real-time graphics & physics techniques.

The challenge

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise when applied to various tasks in games, including game summaries, dialogue, and even gameplay. In the competition for hardware resources, games have been optimized for performance, and every computational resource is crucial. The challenge is to create Small Language Models (SLMs) that are as performant on the task at hand while being reduced in size to run concurrently with the game without affecting game performance.

We are seeking a highly motivated and driven PhD Intern in the area of LMs and games.
We expect the intern to apply the latest state-of-the-art research to create small LMs that are suitable for real-time gameplay. This can include dialogue, decision-making making and planning for our NPCs in our games. Within this work, there are plenty of opportunities to consider how to evaluate models for games, integrate them with existing systems (such as game engines and games), and create a believable and authentic experience for our players. We expect, and encourage, the student to be willing to work with a game engine if that is necessary to complete the task.

As a PhD Intern, you will:
• Perform a state-of-the-art study on LMs, games, and the applications of LMs on games
• Test and evaluate recent papers and open-source projects
• Identify and define some novel approaches and methods
• Plan and build a proof-of-concept demonstration
• Create and execute a full experiment suite to verify and benchmark results
• Analyze and evaluate the results and write a technical report, and share insights by giving presentations to the team

As a diverse team with solid goals, we provide autonomy and true influence to each member of SEED. We are looking for an open and curious person who gets a kick out of taking new ideas, investigating them, and adapting their application to games. You have a desire to explore new areas of game development—someone who is passionate, creative, communicative, and invested.

Qualifications
• Ongoing Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, or any other relevant field
• Experience in LLMs training and modeling, distillation, and RAG-based techniques.
• Basic knowledge of principles for game programming
• You care about video games as a medium.

If you want to be part of—and work with—some of the most incredible people in the field, then SEED is your team!
